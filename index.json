My job in this company is to build SRSS, SAP Business Objects (BO), Power BI, MS Excel, and Tableau report for the crewmember training department. I have built reports for tracking crewmember licenses, their grading analysis, training department, and flight school’s KPIs. A significant part of my job is to liaise with the business stakeholders and gather the requirements to develop reports and assist them to make the decision based on quantitative measurements of the business data. My Ph.D. is in computational plasma physics, so I have an adequate amount of experience with statistics and data analysis, which was found to be very useful with my current job."

Despite his lack of business aviation knowledge, very quickly Adwiteey has adapted to our European and American work environments and Project Subject Matter Experts. Technically Adwitey has demonstrated his enormous knowledge of Structured Query Language(SQL) and was able to develop complex queries and manipulate databases. His phenomenal analytical and reasoning skills were not limited to build reports but also to add value to the product by suggesting innovative solutions, solving problems as they arise, understanding at the same time system and business limitations and supporting the project team as required. He was a very useful piece of our puzzle we will lose now due to budget limitations. He has a very special spark and I trust he will go far by making our world a better place.",
